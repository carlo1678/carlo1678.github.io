    <p>My name is Carlo! I'm a 25 year old U.S. Navy Veteran currently trying to figure life out! I've always been interested in computers and I've always been super tech savvy, so I figured I'd try my hand in coding! I'm super stoked to start this journey with you all, and I look forward to working with you all!
